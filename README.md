# first-neural-network-mnist

In this part we will implement our first Neural Network! We will use fully connecter Neural Network in order to classify handwritten digits. We will use the well known MNIST dataset. The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.
